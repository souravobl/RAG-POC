It is a controllable and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate the curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt to answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of electric current and its applications. 11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT We are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow. How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges.",

However , electr ons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges. Reprint 2025-26",

(W e know that an electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u201319 C.) The electric current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775\u20131836). One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere (1 mA = 10\u20133 A) or in microampere (1 \u00b5A = 10\u20136 A). An instrument called ammeter measures electric current in a circuit. It is always connected in series in a circuit through which the current is to be measured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key. Note that the electric current flows in the circuit from the positive ter minal of the cell to the negative terminal of the cell thr ough the bulb and ammeter .

Let us consider the analogy of flow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure \u2013 called the potential differenc e \u2013 along the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other \u2013 Potential dif ference ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q) V=W/Q (11.2) The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandr o Volta (174 5\u20131827), an Italian physicist.",

Thus the V\u2013I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio. In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787\u20131854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm\u2019s law. In other words \u2013 V \u221d I (11.4) or V/I =constant =R or V =IR (11.5) In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI unit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter \u2126. Accor ding to Ohm\u2019s law, R = V/I (11.6) If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor is 1 \u2126.",

That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt 1 ampere Also from Eq. (11.5) we get I = V/R (11.7) It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable resistance.

What current will the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V? Solution We are given, potential dif ference V = 60 V , current I = 4 A. According to Ohm\u2019s law, 60 V= = 154 AVRI= \u2126. When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is given by current = 120 V= = 8 A15 V R \u2126. The current through the heater becomes 8 A. Example 11.5 Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 \u2126 at 20\u00b0C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material of the wire. Solution We are given the resistance R of the wir e = 26 \u2126, the diameter d = 0.3 mm = 3 \u00d7 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m. Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is \u03c1= (RA/l) = (R \u03c0d2/4l) Substitution of values in this gives \u03c1= 1.84 \u00d7 10\u20136 \u2126 m The resistivity of the metal at 20\u00b0C is 1.84 \u00d7 10\u20136 \u2126 m. From Table 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese. Example 11.6 A wire of given material having length l and area of cross-section A has a resistance of 4 \u2126. What would be the resistance of another wire of the same material having length l/2 and area of cross-section 2 A?

By applying Ohm\u2019s law to the parallel combination of resistors, we have I = V/Rp(11.16) On applying Ohm\u2019s law to each resistor , we have I1 = V /R1; I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17) From Eqs.

Calculate (a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing in the circuit. Solution Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an equivalent resistor of resistance, R \u2032. Similarly we replace the parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R\u2033. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have 1/ R\u2032 = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R\u2032 = 8 \u2126 . Similarly, 1/ R\u2033=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60; that is, R\u2033 = 10 \u2126. Thus, the total resistance, R = R\u2032 + R\u2033 = 18 \u2126. To calculate the current, we use Ohm\u2019s law, and get I = V/R = 12 V/18 \u2126 = 0.67 A. We have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant throughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.

The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater , electric ir on etc. Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t.

    "text": "Electricity 189Applying Ohm\u2019s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get H = I2 Rt (11.21) This is known as Joule\u2019s law of heating. The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the r esistor . In practical situations, when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after calculating the current through it, using the relation I = V/R . Example 11.10 An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The voltage is 220 V . What ar e the curr ent and the r esistance in each case? Solution From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is P = V I Thus the current I = P/V (a)When heating is at the maximum rate, I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 \u2126. (b)When heating is at the minimum rate, I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 \u2126. Example 11.11 100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 \u2126 resistance. Find the potential dif ference acr oss the r esistor . Solution H = 100 J, R = 4 \u2126, t = 1 s, V = ? From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as I = \u221a(H/Rt ) = \u221a[100 J/(4 \u2126 \u00d7 1 s)] =5 A Thus the potential dif ference acr oss the r esistor , V [from Eq.",

    "text": "Science 19011.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications. The electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule\u2019s heating. The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point 3380\u00b0C) is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated. Another common application of Joule\u2019s heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit.",

This is also the rate of consumption of ener gy. Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric cir cuit. This is also ter med as electric power . The power P is given by P = VI Or P = I2R = V2/R (11.22) The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V . Thus, 1 W = 1 volt \u00d7 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23) The unit \u2018watt\u2019 is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called \u2018kilowatt\u2019. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour . The commer cial unit of electric ener gy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as \u2018unit\u2019. 1 kW h =1000 watt \u00d7 3600 second =3.6 \u00d7 106 watt second =3.6 \u00d7 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong! We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide ener gy to move electr ons through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines.
