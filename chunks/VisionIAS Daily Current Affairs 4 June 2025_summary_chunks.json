The Q factor is the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed in heating the plasma inside the fusion reactor. About Fusion-Fission Hybrid Reactor Concept: Uses high intensity neutron flux produced by a fusion reactor to drive a nuclear fission reaction, and breed fissile fuel from fertile materials. Design: Contains a nuclear fusion reactor core where deuterium and tritium nuclei are fused to form helium and a fast neutron, surrounded by a blanket of fertile material (like uranium-238 or thorium-232). Key Striking features of the Hybrid Reactor Capitalises on the advantages of Fusion and Fission: Fusion reactors are \u2018neutron rich\u2019 and \u2018power poor\u2019 while fission reactors are \u2018neutron poor\u2019 and \u2018power rich\u2019. Low Power Requirements: Fusion power required for hybrid reactor is lesser than pure fusion as its major purpose is the production of neutrons (not energy). Reduced Radioactive Wastes: Neutron flux in the blanket could transmute long-lived radioactive waste into less harmful, short lived, and easier to dispose wastes. Fuel Supply: Hybrid reactor would produce enough fissile fuel through breeding. The fusion neutrons can convert fertile materials into fissile materials (like plutonium-239 or uranium-233) increasing fuel supply. The recent flooding and its magnitude have highlighted North East India\u2019s vulnerability to floods. Reasons for flood vulnerability of North East India River instability: The Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers are braided and unstable in their reaches due to high sediment charges, steep slopes and transverse gradients. Geology: The entire area is part of a seismic zone and periodic severe earthquakes are also a factor of river instability. Hydrometeorology: The drainage area of Brahmaputra, and Barak in India is subjected to cyclonic storms originating in the Bay of Bengal, particularly in the latter part of the monsoon season. Climate change: Although overall rainfall is decreasing in North East, in some areas intensity of rainfall has increased (CSE). For example, in Assam, districts north of the Brahmaputra show an increasing trend in rainfall in the last 30 years (CSE). Drainage congestion: Due to heavy rainfall of short duration coupled with high flow levels in the main river, rainwater is prevented from draining quickly into the riverbed. Anthropogenic: Construction, encroachment of river bodies, embankments, obstructing natural flows, etc. also induce drainage congestion. Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion Fission: Splits heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing energy and neutrons. Fusion: Light atomic nuclei combines to form a heavier nucleus, releasing tremendous energy. Recommendations for enhancing flood resilience of North East India Increase the river water-holding capacity by dredging. Flood Zoning of a river according to flood frequencies. Set up modern weather stations in the upstream catchment of all dams in the North East. Strengthen flood protection structures (currently most are very old). Afforestation and rejuvenation of wetlands",

Key Highlights of the Recent Rules and Regulations 85% Government Jobs Reserved for Locals: Definition of local is provided under the Domicile Certificate Rules, 2025. The reservation is in addition to the current 10% reservation for Economically weaker Sections (EWS). Reservation for Women in LAHDC: Reserve one-third of the seats for women in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils (LAHDC) of Leh and Kargil, through rotation. Language and Cultural Protection: English, Hindi, Urdu, Bhoti, and Purgi made official languages. Institutional backing for promotion of Shina, Brokskat, Balti, and Ladakhi What are the limitations of these regulations? No constitutional protection: All new rules and regulations have been enacted under Article 240 of the Constitution, which empowers the President to make regulations for UTs without the legislature. Thus, they can be amended or withdrawn by the Centre at any time No ban on land ownership by outsiders: This raise concerns due to the growing tourism, construction, and climate-related risks. No local legislature or council with law-making powers: This is in contrast to the power given to the ADCs or ARCs under the Sixth Schedule Limited Cultural Support: There is no clear plan to utilise local languages in schools, government, or courts. Centre Notified Rule and Regulations to Protect Ladakh\u2019s Land, Jobs, Culture, And IdentityTo achieve this, an MoU was signed between Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited (GRSE) and Norway\u2019s Kongsberg Oslo marking an important milestone for India\u2019s shipbuilding sector. GRSE (Kolkata), is a premier Warship building Mini Ratna Category I company under Ministry of Defence. Polar Research Vehicle (PRV) About: It is a ship that serves as a platform for research in the polar regions (around the North and South Poles). Purpose: Equipped with the latest scientific equipment, enabling exploration of the oceans\u2019 depths and study of marine ecosystems. Significance of the Indigenous PRV for India Indigenous Needs: PRV would serve the requirements of National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Goa, who will use it for research activities. Support Existing Scientific Missions: In Antarctica (Maitri [1989] and Bharati [2011] and in the Arctic (Himadri, 2008). Cater to Geo-political and Geo-economic dynamics of the region: Significant for India to assert its presence and interests in the region. Complements Existing Maritime Visions: SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) that leverages India\u2019s vast coastline, strategic location, and maritime heritage and MAHASAGAR (Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security Across the Regions) for holistic maritime engagement. Sagarmala 2.0, Under Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, which is a key pillar of the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 (MAKV). \u2666MAKV seeks to place India among the top five shipbuilding nations by 2047. Others: Climate research, oceanography, and polar logistics. India to build first-ever indigenous Polar Research Vessel (PRV) Part of Article 244(2) of the Constitution Governor's Authority Empowers Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCS) Powers of ADCs and ARCS Applies to 4 States: Assam Meghalaya Tripura Mizoram 6th Schedule of the Constitution Constitutional Provisions for Tribal Areas Legislative Powers - Enact Laws on: Forest Management Agriculture Inheritance Marriage Social Custorms Financial Powers - Authority to: Collect Land Revenue Impose Taxes Regulate Trade Collect Mineral Royalties Other Administrative Powers",
