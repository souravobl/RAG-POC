It is a controllable and convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools, hospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does it flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate the curr ent thr ough an electric cir cuit? In this Chapter , we shall attempt to answer such questions. W e shall also discuss the heating ef fect of electric current and its applications. 11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT We are familiar with air curr ent and water curr ent. W e know that flowing water constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge flows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we say that ther e is an electric curr ent in the conductor . In a tor ch, we know that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide flow of char ges or an electric curr ent thr ough the tor ch bulb to glow. W e have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What does a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the torch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow. How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In other words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges.",

However , electr ons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons, which are negative charges. Reprint 2025-26",

(W e know that an electron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u201319 C.) The electric current is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the French scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775\u20131836). One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is, 1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere (1 mA = 10\u20133 A) or in microampere (1 \u00b5A = 10\u20136 A). An instrument called ammeter measures electric current in a circuit. It is always connected in series in a circuit through which the current is to be measured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic diagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a cell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key. Note that the electric current flows in the circuit from the positive ter minal of the cell to the negative terminal of the cell thr ough the bulb and ammeter .

Let us consider the analogy of flow of water . Char ges do not flow in a copper wir e by themselves, just as water in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube is connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of the other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic wire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure \u2013 called the potential differenc e \u2013 along the conductor . This dif ference of potential may be pr oduced by a battery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell, even when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential dif ference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other \u2013 Potential dif ference ( V) between two points = Work done ( W)/Char ge (Q) V=W/Q (11.2) The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after Alessandr o Volta (174 5\u20131827), an Italian physicist.",

Thus the V\u2013I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant ratio. In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787\u20131854) found out the relationship between the current I, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same. This is called Ohm\u2019s law. In other words \u2013 V \u221d I (11.4) or V/I =constant =R or V =IR (11.5) In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI unit is ohm, r epresented by the Gr eek letter \u2126. Accor ding to Ohm\u2019s law, R = V/I (11.6) If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor is 1 \u2126.",

That is, 1 ohm = 1 volt 1 ampere Also from Eq. (11.5) we get I = V/R (11.7) It is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase or decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable resistance.

What current will the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V? Solution We are given, potential dif ference V = 60 V , current I = 4 A. According to Ohm\u2019s law, 60 V= = 154 AVRI= \u2126. When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is given by current = 120 V= = 8 A15 V R \u2126. The current through the heater becomes 8 A. Example 11.5 Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 \u2126 at 20\u00b0C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material of the wire. Solution We are given the resistance R of the wir e = 26 \u2126, the diameter d = 0.3 mm = 3 \u00d7 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m. Therefore, from Eq. (11.10), the resistivity of the given metallic wire is \u03c1= (RA/l) = (R \u03c0d2/4l) Substitution of values in this gives \u03c1= 1.84 \u00d7 10\u20136 \u2126 m The resistivity of the metal at 20\u00b0C is 1.84 \u00d7 10\u20136 \u2126 m. From Table 11.2, we see that this is the resistivity of manganese. Example 11.6 A wire of given material having length l and area of cross-section A has a resistance of 4 \u2126. What would be the resistance of another wire of the same material having length l/2 and area of cross-section 2 A?

By applying Ohm\u2019s law to the parallel combination of resistors, we have I = V/Rp(11.16) On applying Ohm\u2019s law to each resistor , we have I1 = V /R1; I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3(11.17) From Eqs.

Calculate (a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing in the circuit. Solution Suppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an equivalent resistor of resistance, R \u2032. Similarly we replace the parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R\u2033. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have 1/ R\u2032 = 1/10 + 1/40 =5/40; that is R\u2032 = 8 \u2126 . Similarly, 1/ R\u2033=1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60; that is, R\u2033 = 10 \u2126. Thus, the total resistance, R = R\u2032 + R\u2033 = 18 \u2126. To calculate the current, we use Ohm\u2019s law, and get I = V/R = 12 V/18 \u2126 = 0.67 A. We have seen that in a series cir cuit the curr ent is constant throughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example 11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.

The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a r esistor or a system of r esistors connected to the battery. W e have also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source has to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget. W e often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other hand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating effect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater , electric ir on etc. Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let the potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during which a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t.

    "text": "Electricity 189Applying Ohm\u2019s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get H = I2 Rt (11.21) This is known as Joule\u2019s law of heating. The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is (i) directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to resistance for a given current, and (iii) directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the r esistor . In practical situations, when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after calculating the current through it, using the relation I = V/R . Example 11.10 An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum. The voltage is 220 V . What ar e the curr ent and the r esistance in each case? Solution From Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is P = V I Thus the current I = P/V (a)When heating is at the maximum rate, I = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 \u2126. (b)When heating is at the minimum rate, I = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A; and the resistance of the electric iron is R = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 \u2126. Example 11.11 100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 \u2126 resistance. Find the potential dif ference acr oss the r esistor . Solution H = 100 J, R = 4 \u2126, t = 1 s, V = ? From Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as I = \u221a(H/Rt ) = \u221a[100 J/(4 \u2126 \u00d7 1 s)] =5 A Thus the potential dif ference acr oss the r esistor , V [from Eq.",

    "text": "Science 19011.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of electric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However , heating ef fect of electric curr ent has many useful applications. The electric laundry ir on, electric toaster , electric oven, electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule\u2019s heating. The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric bulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such high temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten (melting point 3380\u00b0C) is used for making bulb filaments. The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using insulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated. Another common application of Joule\u2019s heating is the fuse used in electric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with the device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper , iron, lead etc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit, the temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit.",

This is also the rate of consumption of ener gy. Equation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated or consumed in an electric cir cuit. This is also ter med as electric power . The power P is given by P = VI Or P = I2R = V2/R (11.22) The SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by a device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference of 1 V . Thus, 1 W = 1 volt \u00d7 1 ampere = 1 V A (11.23) The unit \u2018watt\u2019 is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a much larger unit called \u2018kilowatt\u2019. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is, therefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when 1 watt of power is used for 1 hour . The commer cial unit of electric ener gy is kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as \u2018unit\u2019. 1 kW h =1000 watt \u00d7 3600 second =3.6 \u00d7 106 watt second =3.6 \u00d7 106 joule (J)More to Know!Many people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong! We pay the electricity board or electric company to provide ener gy to move electr ons through the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines.

He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u04e7grens Synd rome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17 -30%8 in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient\u2019s laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS -A, neck CT showing chronic enlar gement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a ne urological manifestation of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease , normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \u201c Patients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involve ment of more than one cell line \u201c3. This hematologic man ifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia . This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome, is aut onomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness , early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient \u2019s headaches with lightheadedness , as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u04e7gren\u2019s syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations.",

    "text": "Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are we ll defined, while others are ill defined. The pre - auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Plan: A Schirmer test would help differentiate if the burning sensation in the eyes is du e to dry eyes or another cause , possibly trigeminal neuralgia . Acutely, the patient should be started on corticosteroids to treat the acute symptoms of Sj\u04e7grens syndrome. Long term, hydrochloroquin e or an immunosuppressant may want to be considered. This should help with the joint pain and constitutional symptoms. Monitoring of RBC and WBC should be continued to make sure they return to normal ranges after this acute event. Alternative: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Assessment: SLE is another very possible diagnosis. The history of autoimmune diseases, paired with the SS -A and dsDNA can point us towards a diagnosis of Lupus. The anemia and leukopenia can also be accounted for by SLE. However, SLE would not explain the dry mouth and burning eyes, nor would it explain the parotid gland involvement. However, the macular rash in the pre -auricular area, which the sister described as extending over the eyelids and bridge of the nose, does sound suspicious of the malar rash. However, at the time of physical exam, the rash was only seen in the pre-auricular area . The patient denies any photosensitivity. While SLE cannot be rule d out at this time, Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome accounts for a more global diagnosis of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Plan: Continue to monitor kidney function, as SS -a in Lupus increases the risk of Lupus Nephritis. Treatment for acute exacerbation is still corticosteroids.",

The severity of this diagnosis makes it a do not miss in the differential. However, the small size of the lymph nodes, 4 -5 mm, and the nature, not -fixed, makes this diagnosis less likely.

The Q factor is the ratio of energy produced to energy consumed in heating the plasma inside the fusion reactor. About Fusion-Fission Hybrid Reactor Concept: Uses high intensity neutron flux produced by a fusion reactor to drive a nuclear fission reaction, and breed fissile fuel from fertile materials. Design: Contains a nuclear fusion reactor core where deuterium and tritium nuclei are fused to form helium and a fast neutron, surrounded by a blanket of fertile material (like uranium-238 or thorium-232). Key Striking features of the Hybrid Reactor Capitalises on the advantages of Fusion and Fission: Fusion reactors are \u2018neutron rich\u2019 and \u2018power poor\u2019 while fission reactors are \u2018neutron poor\u2019 and \u2018power rich\u2019. Low Power Requirements: Fusion power required for hybrid reactor is lesser than pure fusion as its major purpose is the production of neutrons (not energy). Reduced Radioactive Wastes: Neutron flux in the blanket could transmute long-lived radioactive waste into less harmful, short lived, and easier to dispose wastes. Fuel Supply: Hybrid reactor would produce enough fissile fuel through breeding. The fusion neutrons can convert fertile materials into fissile materials (like plutonium-239 or uranium-233) increasing fuel supply. The recent flooding and its magnitude have highlighted North East India\u2019s vulnerability to floods. Reasons for flood vulnerability of North East India River instability: The Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers are braided and unstable in their reaches due to high sediment charges, steep slopes and transverse gradients.",

    "text": "Reasons for flood vulnerability of North East India River instability: The Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers are braided and unstable in their reaches due to high sediment charges, steep slopes and transverse gradients. Geology: The entire area is part of a seismic zone and periodic severe earthquakes are also a factor of river instability. Hydrometeorology: The drainage area of Brahmaputra, and Barak in India is subjected to cyclonic storms originating in the Bay of Bengal, particularly in the latter part of the monsoon season. Climate change: Although overall rainfall is decreasing in North East, in some areas intensity of rainfall has increased (CSE). For example, in Assam, districts north of the Brahmaputra show an increasing trend in rainfall in the last 30 years (CSE). Drainage congestion: Due to heavy rainfall of short duration coupled with high flow levels in the main river, rainwater is prevented from draining quickly into the riverbed. Anthropogenic: Construction, encroachment of river bodies, embankments, obstructing natural flows, etc. also induce drainage congestion. Nuclear Fission and Nuclear Fusion Fission: Splits heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing energy and neutrons. Fusion: Light atomic nuclei combines to form a heavier nucleus, releasing tremendous energy. Recommendations for enhancing flood resilience of North East India Increase the river water-holding capacity by dredging. Flood Zoning of a river according to flood frequencies. Set up modern weather stations in the upstream catchment of all dams in the North East. Strengthen flood protection structures (currently most are very old).
