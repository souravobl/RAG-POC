History of Present Illness: Patient is a 48 year -old well -nourished Hispanic male with a 2-month history of Rheumatoid Arthritis and strong family history of autoimmune diseases presenting after an episode of lightheadedness and muscle weakness . Patient began experiencing symptoms 4 months ago (November 2017). At that time he experienced fatigue and joi nt pain in the knees and hands. He was diagnosed with Rhe umatoid Arthritis. He was given a short course of corticosteroids at that time that allevi ated his symptoms. He was also started on methotrexate at that time. However , he felt that the medication was ineffective and stopped after 2 weeks. For the past two months, the patient has been ex periencing worsening symptoms. He has been experiencing pro gressively worsening headaches accompanied with lightheadedness , light and sound sensitivity, nausea, and vomiting . He reports no loss of consciousness associated with the headaches. No convulsion, change of vision, or loss of continence. When the headaches began 2 months ago, they would last about half of a day and occ ur approximately once per week. They increased in frequency and duration and over the last month have been almost daily and last ed most of the day. He is unable to eat during h eadaches. Concurrently, the patient is experiencing worsening joint pain in the knees and hands. The pain is constant, accompanied by swollen and hot joints, and not alleviated by NSAIDS. Also in the last two months, he has experienced a dry mouth that m akes swallowing food difficult and a burning sensation in his eyes. In the last month, the patient has been experiencing night sweats, chills, and subjective fevers almost every night. This has impacted his sleep significantly, and he has not been able t o sleep more than 4 consecutive hours in over one month. Three days ago, the patient was at work when a headache came on, he felt particularly light headed and weak. His left work early on that day. In the last three days the patient has had a constant h eadache and lightheadedness , and felt unable to eat. When he has tried to eat, he has v omited immediately after eating. He has had no changes to his bowel movement s. No blood in the stool or urine . The joint pain has returned to a 10/10 in severity in th e past 3 days . The patient has felt too weak to walk or leave the bedroom. He was brough t to the hospital by his sister, a nurse, after two days being unable to leave bed. At this time, his sister noticed a facial rash in the pre -auricular area that ex tended over the eyelids and bridge of the nose This sample summative H&P was written by a second\u2010year medical student from UCF COM Class of 2020 at the end of COP\u20102. While not perfect, it best exemplifies the documentation skills students are expected and able to acquire by the end of P\u20102: organization, thoroughness, relevance, chronology, integrated topic review, documentation of references, etc. For additional H&P samples go to P -2 Webcourses home page and click on the COP/Portfolio Resources page.",

    "text": "Assessment and Plan: Differential diagnosis includes: Most Likely: Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome Assessment: The patient has a personal history of autoimmune disease and a positive HLA genotype . He was diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis 2 months ago. His presenting symptom of bilateral joint pain in the knees and fingers paired with a positive RF, CCP, and decreased CD4 count made this diagnosis very likely. Sj\u04e7grens Synd rome is very heavily associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis, estimated prevalence between 17 -30%8 in those with previously diagnosed Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient\u2019s laboratory and imaging studies, including a positive SS -A, neck CT showing chronic enlar gement of the Parotid Gland, paired with the symptom of dry mouth and a burning sensation of the eye, a possible manifestation of dry eyes, are suggestive of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome. Another possible cause of the burning sensation is trigeminal neuralgia, a ne urological manifestation of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. However, this patient also presents with some of rarer manifestations of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome. According to UpToDate: Clinical manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease , normochromic normocytic anemia can be seen in up to 20% of sjogrens patients. Further, \u201c Patients with SS may exhibit abnormal counts in any cell line, and patients with cytopenia often have involve ment of more than one cell line \u201c3. This hematologic man ifestation of disease accounts for many of the abnormal blood tests including the anemia and leukopenia . This anemia could be the underlying cause of the lightheadedness and muscle weakness. Further, a more rare manifestation of Sj\u04e7grens Syndrome, is aut onomic neuropathy3. Autonomic neuropathy manifests as headache, lightheadedness , early satiety, vomiting, weight loss, and sweating abnormalities. The patient \u2019s headaches with lightheadedness , as well as his GI symptoms and night sweats can be explained by the neurological manifestations of Sj\u04e7gren\u2019s syndrome. Finally, autoimmune diseases are often associated with cutaneous manifestations. Some of these, such as the malar rash of lupus are we ll defined, while others are ill defined. The pre - auricular rash can be seen as an atypical cutaneous presentation of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Plan: A Schirmer test would help differentiate if the burning sensation in the eyes is du e to dry eyes or another cause , possibly trigeminal neuralgia . Acutely, the patient should be started on corticosteroids to treat the acute symptoms of Sj\u04e7grens syndrome. Long term, hydrochloroquin e or an immunosuppressant may want to be considered. This should help with the joint pain and constitutional symptoms. Monitoring of RBC and WBC should be continued to make sure they return to normal ranges after this acute event. Alternative: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Assessment: SLE is another very possible diagnosis. The history of autoimmune diseases, paired with the SS -A and dsDNA can point us towards a diagnosis of Lupus. The anemia and leukopenia can also be accounted for by SLE. However, SLE would not explain the dry mouth and burning eyes, nor would it explain the parotid gland involvement. However, the macular rash in the pre -auricular area, which the sister described as extending over the eyelids and bridge of the nose, does sound suspicious of the malar rash. However, at the time of physical exam, the rash was only seen in the pre-auricular area . The patient denies any photosensitivity. While SLE cannot be rule d out at this time, Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome accounts for a more global diagnosis of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Plan: Continue to monitor kidney function, as SS -a in Lupus increases the risk of Lupus Nephritis. Treatment for acute exacerbation is still corticosteroids.",

    "text": "Do Not Miss: B-Cell Lymphoma Assessment: Patients with b oth Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sj\u04e7grens syndrome have an increased risk of B -Cell lymphoma. This patient is experiencing night sweats, unintentional weight loss, subjective fever, and lymphadenopathy. He also has enlargement of the Parotid gland. The severity of this diagnosis makes it a do not miss in the differential. However, the small size of the lymph nodes, 4 -5 mm, and the nature, not -fixed, makes this diagnosis less likely. Further, while the patient is experiencing Leukopenia, it is not extreme. We would expect a much lower WBC if this were a lym phoma. Plan: Biopsy of the paroti d gland and/ or cervical lymph nodes to rule out lymphoma. Sources: 1. Chai J, Logigian EL. Neurological manifestations of primary Sjogren's syndrome.
